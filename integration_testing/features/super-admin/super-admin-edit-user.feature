  Feature: Super admin can see that their role is distinguished in the user list in *Facility > Users* and there are different Options options than other users

    Scenario: Super admin can see the label *Super admin* next to their full name, not their facility role
      When I scroll to my name in the user list
      Then I see a label *Super admin* next to my full name

        And I click on the *Options* dropdown button
      Then I see that the *Delete* action is disabled

  Feature: Super admin cannot edit their own user type from the *Edit user* modal, but can find a cross link to the Device permissions page

    Scenario: Super admin can see the read-only label *Super admin* under *User type*, not their facility role
      When I look at the field for *User type*
      Then I see that I am a Super admin
      And a message that directs me to *Device permissions* to view more details

    Scenario: Super admin navigates to *Device permissions* from the *Edit user* modal
      When I click on the link to *Device permissions*
      Then I am redirected to my permissions page in *Device > Permissions*

    	When I look at the field for *User type*
    	Then I see that I am a Super admin
    	And a message that directs me to *Device permissions* to make changes

    Scenario: Super admin navigates to *Device permissions* from the *Edit user details* modal
